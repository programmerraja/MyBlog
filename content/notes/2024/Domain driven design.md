## Putting the Domain Model to Work

#### Crunching Knowledge

the iterative process of understanding the domain and refining the model based on continuous learning

## Communication and the Use of Language

The Ubiquitous Language is a common, shared language that both technical and non-technical team members use to discuss the domain. It ensures that everyone understands the domain's terms and concepts.

`Use the model as the backbone of a language. Committhe team to exercising that language relentlessly in all communication within the team and in the code. Use the same language in diagrams, writing, and especially speech`

## Binding Model and I mplementation

tell dont ask -> if u have module that u want to do some validation u write a function that get required data from module and do the validation in here we just getting the data so  instead put the validation inside module



### **Bounded Contexts**

Bounded Contexts are explicit boundaries within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. They help prevent conflicts and misunderstandings when working on large, complex systems.

### **Entities and Value Objects**

Entities are objects with distinct identities that are defined by their attributes. Value Objects, on the other hand, are objects defined by their attributes but without a distinct identity. They represent concepts like dates, money, or geographical coordinates.

### **Aggregates**

Aggregates are groups of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They enforce consistency and transactional boundaries within the domain.

### The Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that acts as an abstraction layer between your domain model and the data access code. It provides a set of methods for querying and manipulating domain objects without exposing the underlying data store (such as a database or web service)


### Tactical Design Patterns

three fundamental building blocks: Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates

### Â **Entities**

Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. Think of them as nouns in your domain. Entities are often the most critical elements within your domain model. They have a lifecycle and can change over time while preserving their identity.

### **Value Objects**

Value Objects represent concepts like dates, money, addresses, and more. They are immutable, meaning their attributes cannot change once set.

### **Aggregates**

are clusters of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They ensure transactional consistency within a part of your domain. 
Example : An "Order" Aggregate could include the Order Entity as the Aggregate Root and related Order Items as Entities or Value Objects.
