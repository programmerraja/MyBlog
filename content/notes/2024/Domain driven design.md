## Putting the Domain Model to Work

#### Crunching Knowledge

the iterative process of understanding the domain and refining the model based on continuous learning

## Communication and the Use of Language

The Ubiquitous Language is a common, shared language that both technical and non-technical team members use to discuss the domain. It ensures that everyone understands the domain's terms and concepts.

`Use the model as the backbone of a language. Committhe team to exercising that language relentlessly in all communication within the team and in the code. Use the same language in diagrams, writing, and especially speech`

## Binding Model and Implementation


vaule objects
tell dont ask -> if u have module that u want to do some validation u write a function that get required data from module and do the validation in here we just getting the data so  instead put the validation inside module

### **Bounded Contexts**

Bounded Contexts are explicit boundaries within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. They help prevent conflicts and misunderstandings when working on large, complex systems.

### **Entities and Value Objects**

Entities are objects with distinct identities that are defined by their attributes. Value Objects, on the other hand, are objects defined by their attributes but without a distinct identity. They represent concepts like dates, money, or geographical coordinates.

### **Aggregates**

Aggregates are groups of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They enforce consistency and transactional boundaries within the domain.

### The Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that acts as an abstraction layer between your domain model and the data access code. It provides a set of methods for querying and manipulating domain objects without exposing the underlying data store (such as a database or web service)


### Tactical Design Patterns

three fundamental building blocks: Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates

### Â **Entities**

Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. Think of them as nouns in your domain. Entities are often the most critical elements within your domain model. They have a lifecycle and can change over time while preserving their identity.

In E-commerce customer is entites

### **Value Objects**

Value Objects represent concepts like dates, money, addresses, and more. They are immutable, meaning their attributes cannot change once set.

### **Aggregates**

are clusters of related Entities and Value Objects treated as a single unit. They ensure transactional consistency within a part of your domain. 
Example : An "Order" Aggregate could include the Order Entity as the Aggregate Root and related Order Items as Entities or Value Objects.

1. **Entities:**
   - **Definition:** Entities are objects with a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. They are typically mutable and are defined by their attributes.
   - **Example:** In an e-commerce system, a "Customer" could be an entity. The identity of a customer persists even if their information, such as the shipping address, changes.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Entities should be identifiable by a unique identifier.
     - Changes to the state of an entity are significant and affect its identity.
     - Business rules often revolve around entities.

2. **Value Objects:**
   - **Definition:** Value Objects are objects without a distinct identity; they are defined by their attributes. They are immutable and represent a descriptive aspect of the domain.
   - **Example:** A "Money" value object representing a specific amount in a certain currency. The key here is that the value itself is what matters, not any inherent identity.
   - **Considerations:**
     - Equality of value objects is determined by the equality of their attributes.
     - They should be immutable; any change results in a new instance.
     - They represent concepts rather than individual entities.

3. **Aggregates:**
   - **Definition:** Aggregates are clusters of entities and value objects treated as a single unit. They have a root entity that serves as the entry point for interactions with the rest of the aggregate.
   - **Example:** In an e-commerce system, an "Order" could be an aggregate consisting of entities like "Customer," "Product," and value objects like "OrderItem."
   - **Considerations:**
     - The root entity ensures consistency and controls access to the aggregate.
     - Aggregates encapsulate business rules that involve multiple entities.
     - Changes within an aggregate are transactionally consistent.

**How to decide:**
   - **Identity and Mutability:**
     - If identity is crucial, and the object's state changes significantly, it is likely an entity.
     - If the emphasis is on the attributes' value, and changes result in a new instance, it is likely a value object.
   - **Transactional Consistency:**
     - If a group of objects needs to be treated as a single unit regarding consistency, they should be part of the same aggregate.
   - **Business Rules:**
     - Entities often encapsulate business rules specific to them.
     - Aggregates encapsulate business rules involving multiple entities.

**Example:**
Let's consider an online shopping scenario:

- **Entities:**
  - "Customer" (with a unique identifier, mutable attributes).
  - "Product" (with a unique identifier, mutable attributes).

- **Value Objects:**
  - "Price" (immutable, defined by amount and currency).
  - "Address" (immutable, defined by street, city, etc.).

- **Aggregates:**
  - "Order" (root entity, consists of "Customer," "Product," "Price," and "Address").
    - Ensures that changes to the order are transactionally consistent.
    - Manages business rules related to the order.

By carefully considering the nature of objects and their relationships, you can model your domain effectively using Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates in a way that reflects the real-world scenario you're addressing.
