**[garak](https://reference.garak.ai/en/latest/basic.html)** is an LLM vulnerability scanner, It uses a huge range of probes to examine and query a large language model, simulating attacks, and uses a range of detectors on the model’s outputs to see if the model was vulnerable to any of those attacks.
