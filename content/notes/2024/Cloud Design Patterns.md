##  Data Management
1. **Cache-Aside Pattern.** Improve application performance and reduce the load on data stores by caching frequently accessed data.

2. **Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern**. Separate read and write operations to optimize performance, scalability, and security.

3. **Event Sourcing Pattern.** Maintain a complete history of changes to an application's data.

4. **Materialized View Pattern.** Improve query performance by precomputing and storing the results of complex queries.

5. **Sharding Pattern.** Scale data storage by partitioning data across multiple databases or servers.

## Design and Implementation

1. **Strangler Fig Pattern.** Gradually migrate a legacy system by replacing specific pieces with new applications or services.

2. **Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern.** This pattern protects a new system's integrity when integrating legacy or external systems with different models or paradigms.

3. **Bulkhead Pattern.** Increase system resilience by isolating failures in one component from affecting others.

4. **Sidecar Pattern**: Deploy a parallel component to extend or enhance a service's functionality without modifying its code.

5. **The Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern** involves creating separate backend services tailored to the needs of different client applications (e.g., web and mobile).

## Messaging

1. **Queue-Based Load Leveling Pattern.** Manage varying workloads by buffering incoming requests and ensuring your system can handle load fluctuations smoothly.

2. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern.** Enable an application to broadcast messages to multiple consumers without being tightly coupled to them.

3. **Competing Consumers Pattern.** Enhance scalability and throughput by having multiple consumers process messages concurrently.

4. **Message Broker Pattern.** Decouple applications by introducing an intermediary that handles message routing, transformation, and delivery.

5. **Pipes and Filters Pattern.** Process data through a sequence of processing components (filters) connected by channels (pipes).

## Security

1. **Valet Key Pattern.** Provide clients with secure, temporary access to specific resources without exposing sensitive credentials.

2. **Gatekeeper Pattern.** Protect backend services by validating and sanitizing requests through a dedicated host acting as a gatekeeper.

3. **Federated Identity Pattern.** Simplify user authentication by allowing users to log in with existing credentials from trusted identity providers.

4. **Secret Store Pattern.** Securely manage sensitive configuration data such as passwords, API keys, and connection strings.

5. **Validation Pattern.** Protect applications by ensuring all input data is validated and sanitized before processing.

## Reliability

1. **Retry Pattern.** Handle transient failures by automatically retrying failed operations to increase the chances of success.

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern.** This pattern prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation likely to fail, protecting system resources and improving stability.

3. **Throttling Pattern.** Control the consumption of resources by limiting the rate at which an application processes requests.

4. **Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern.** Detect system failures proactively by exposing health check endpoints that monitoring tools can access.
