# ADR: Decision to Use a Microservices Architecture

## Context
We are building a new e-commerce platform that requires scalability and flexibility.

## Decision
We will use a microservices architecture to allow for independent development and deployment of each service.

## Constraints
* We need to ensure high availability and scalability.
* We need to minimize dependencies between services.

## Consequences
* We will need to invest in additional infrastructure and tooling to support microservices.
* We will need to develop new skills and expertise in areas such as service discovery and communication.

## Alternatives
* We considered using a monolithic architecture, but it would not provide the same level of scalability and flexibility.
