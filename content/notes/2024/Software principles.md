## Stable Dependency Principle

**Stable components:** are components that aren't expected to change that often.

**Volatile components:** are ones that are more likely to jitter and require frequent changes.

it's important to know when a component is volatile and ensure that we don't make stable components depend on them.

##  Responsibility-Driven Design
Start with a requirement (functional or non-functional), convert it into responsibilities, assign those to roles, then find the collaborations.
