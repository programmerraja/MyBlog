### The Accountability Dial steps

**AccountabilityDial** is a framework designed to help teams and organizations maintain accountability in their process

### 1. The Mention

**Purpose:**  
This is the first step where you address an issue as soon as you notice it. The goal is to bring the behavior or concern to the person's attention in real-time or as close to it as possible.

**Action:**  
Pull the person aside for a brief, informal conversation. Mention what you’re noticing without making it a big deal. This is more about awareness than criticism.

### 2. The Invitation

**Purpose:**  
If the behavior continues, you move to the next step. Here, you provide more context to help the person understand the pattern of behavior that needs to be addressed.

**Action:**  
Present two or three examples of the behavior that demonstrate it's not just a one-time occurrence but a pattern. Invite the person to reflect on these examples and consider how they can work on them.

### 3. The Conversation

**Purpose:**  
This step involves a deeper discussion. It’s about helping the person understand how their behavior is affecting their goals or the team's goals.

**Action:**  
Use a scheduled meeting, such as a weekly one-on-one, to explore the issue more thoroughly. Guide the person to recognize how the behavior is holding them back and brainstorm ways to improve. The conversation should be constructive and focused on personal and professional growth.

### 4. The Boundary

**Purpose:**  
At this stage, it’s essential to set clear expectations for change. The goal is to establish an agreement on what needs to be done and by when.

**Action:**  
Make a concrete agreement about the changes that need to occur. Specify the timeline for these changes and the specific actions the person commits to taking. Both parties should be clear on the expectations moving forward.

### 5. The Limit

**Purpose:**  
This is the final step before deciding on more severe consequences. It's a last effort to encourage meaningful change.

**Action:**  
Have one more in-depth conversation, expressing that this is their final opportunity to make a significant improvement. The tone should be serious but supportive, emphasizing that this is the last chance for a breakthrough before more drastic measures are considered.
