##  CRAG

Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation.The strategy we followed for this let’s say for each topic, we consult the book and identify relevant sections. Before forming an opinion, categorize the gathered information into three groups: `**Correct**`, `**Incorrect**`, and `**Ambiguous**`. Process each type of information separately. Then, based on this processed information, compile and summarize it mentally


## Micro Agent

AI agents are cool, but general-purpose coding agents rarely work as hoped or promised. They tend to go haywire with compounding errors. Think of your Roomba getting stuck under a table, x1000.

Tools
-  Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.

**Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.
## Nerve
 Red team with AI
**[Nerve](https://github.com/evilsocket/nerve) is a tool that creates stateful agents with any LLM — without writing a single line of code.** Agents created with Nerve are capable of both planning and enacting step-by-step whatever actions are required to complete a user-defined task.
