## percentage

If you need a percentage of a number, just multiply the number by the percentage (written as a decimal). This method works for any percentage!

 Find 15% of ₹5000.

1. **Convert 15% to a decimal**:  
    15%=15100=0.1515\% = \frac{15}{100} = 0.1515%=10015​=0.15
2. **Multiply by the number (₹5000)**:  
    0.15×5000=₹750

So, **15% of ₹5000 is ₹750**.
