## Cockroach DB
SQL distributed database 

## [fauna](https://fauna.com/)
Fauna is a distributed document-relational database that combines the flexibility of documents with the power of a relational, ACID compliant database that scales across regions, clouds or the globe.


## Tools

#### [Ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) 
ingestr is a CLI tool to copy data between any databases with a single command seamlessly.

#### [Debezium](https://debezium.io/)
Debezium is an open source distributed platform for change data capture. Start it up, point it at your databases, and your apps can start responding to all of the inserts, updates, and deletes that other apps commit to your databases.

**Sharding** -involves distributing Partitioning data across multiple independent databases or shards. replica are also called sharding because the shard the same data in both server

## Database Partitioning

#### **Vertical Partitioning** 

 - In vertical partitioning, data within a table is divided vertically based on columns in to multiple database.
 - In here we splitting the table in to two based on requirement let say you have user table which has name,email,etc if we split basic user info in single table and other info as another table
#### **Horizontal Partitioning**

- In this we split the data in two database based on shard key let say from user name start with A to F will be in one database and other's in new database
