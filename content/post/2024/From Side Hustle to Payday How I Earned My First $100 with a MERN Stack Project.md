It was during the lockdown—a time when the world felt like it had pressed pause. Classes moved online, and like many others, I found myself with a lot more time on my hands. Instead of just scrolling through endless social media feeds, I decided to dive into something productive. I chose to learn the MERN stack—a powerful combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

As someone who loves turning theory into practice, I didn't just want to learn the MERN stack; I wanted to build something with it. The idea of creating a unique project that could be genuinely useful to others always excited me. That's when I came up with the concept of an IP Logger.

The idea was simple but intriguing. Users would sign up, log in, and be able to generate a new link from any URL they wanted to share. When someone clicked on this new link, their IP address and other details would be captured and stored on our server. After that, they would be redirected to the original URL. It was a tool that could provide valuable insights into who was clicking your links.

Fueled by excitement, I spent the next two days coding non-stop. The process was intense but incredibly rewarding. There’s something thrilling about watching your ideas take shape, line by line. Finally, the project was ready. I hosted it, making it accessible to anyone who wanted to try it out, and uploaded the code to GitHub for others to see and perhaps even contribute. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/programmerraja/IpLogger).

Weeks went by, and I was busy with other things when, out of the blue, I received a notification on GitHub. A stranger had opened an issue on my project, asking if I could add a feature to record the time and date when someone clicked the link. It was a simple request, but it made me realize that someone out there found my project useful enough to suggest an improvement. That was a huge motivation boost.

Curious and eager to help, I reached out to the stranger, and we started chatting on Telegram. He explained that he had no experience with the MERN stack but really liked the idea of the IP Logger. After a brief discussion, I added the new feature he requested, making the tool even more powerful.

He was impressed and then asked for more help—this time with hosting the project on his virtual machine. Hosting a MERN stack project can be tricky, especially for someone new to the stack. I walked him through the entire process, from setting up the server to deploying the project. After everything was up and running smoothly, he offered me $100 for my time and effort.

I was thrilled. Not only had I created something useful, but it also led to my first real earnings from a project. It was more than just the money; it was the realization that the skills I was learning in college could actually have a tangible impact—and get me paid!

This experience taught me the value of practical skills and the importance of sharing your work with the world. You never know who might find it helpful or what opportunities it could lead to. For me, it was the start of something much bigger, and it all began with a simple project during the lockdown.
