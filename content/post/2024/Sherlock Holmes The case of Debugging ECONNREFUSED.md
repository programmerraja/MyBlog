Migrating to Kubernetes can be a smooth process, but sometimes, unexpected challenges crop up. One issue we faced was the frequent `ECONNREFUSED` errors on our proxy server, which significantly impacted our users' experience. In this post, I’ll share how we investigated the problem, uncovered the underlying causes, and implemented a solution.

### The Case of the Vanishing Connection

Imagine this scenario: after a seemingly successful migration to Kubernetes, everything appears to be running smoothly. Suddenly, reports flood in from users about pages failing to load intermittently and certain endpoints causing internal server errors. These issues occurred randomly, yet frequently, leaving us puzzled. Upon checking the server logs, we found the culprit: `ECONNREFUSED`. Typically, this error signals that the server isn't listening on the expected port—definitely a cause for concern.

### Time to Investigate

Armed with curiosity and determination, I dove into the investigation. It quickly became clear that these errors primarily cropped up during our deployment windows. I cross-referenced the timestamps of the failures with our deployment schedule, and the correlation was undeniable. You might be thinking, “But isn’t Kubernetes designed to handle this seamlessly?” Absolutely! Kubernetes employs a rolling update strategy to eliminate downtime.

Let’s break down the Kubernetes deployment process to understand how it should work:

1. **New Pods Come Alive**: When deploying a new version, Kubernetes spins up new pods while keeping the old ones running.
2. **The Readiness Check**: It uses readiness probes to determine when the new pods are ready to serve traffic.
3. **The Great Switcheroo**: Once the readiness probes return success, Kubernetes sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the old pods, instructing them to gracefully shut down.

At first glance, this process seemed foolproof. So, why were we still encountering those frustrating errors?

### The Aha Moment

As I dug deeper, I uncovered a critical piece of the puzzle: the delay in updating the kube-proxy IP tables. Here’s how the process unfolds:

- When new pods are marked as ready, Kubernetes updates the routing information and simultaneously sends a `SIGTERM` signal to the old pod.
- Once the IP tables are updated, the new pod begins to receive incoming requests.

However, there’s typically a lag of about 10 to 15 seconds before the IP tables are fully updated. During this window, requests continue to be proxied to the old pod, which has already received the `SIGTERM` signal. This causes the old pod to begin shutting down, resulting in it rejecting any incoming connections. Consequently, any requests sent during this time receive an `ECONNREFUSED` error.

```

### Crafting the Solution

Realizing that we needed a solution, I focused on ensuring that the old pod could finish handling its requests before shutting down. The fix was simple yet effective: we modified our signal handling code to include a delay before termination:

```javascript
process.on("SIGTERM", async function () {
    // Wait for 15 seconds to allow existing requests to complete
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 15000));
    // Close the database connection, server, and perform other cleanup tasks
});
```


With this change implemented, we watched the `ECONNREFUSED` errors vanish as if by magic! The old pod now had ample time to wrap up any ongoing requests, ensuring a smooth transition and a seamless user experience. It felt like we had turned a corner—a victory born from persistence and a willingness to dig deep.

### Final Reflections

Debugging in Kubernetes can be like navigating a maze: every turn presents new challenges, and the path isn’t always clear. However, by understanding the intricate details of how Kubernetes handles deployments, we were able to troubleshoot effectively and implement a graceful shutdown mechanism that enhanced our service reliability.

I hope this tale of our Kubernetes quest inspires you in your own debugging adventures. Have you faced similar issues or have thoughts on deployment strategies? Let’s spark a conversation in the comments below—your insights might just light the way for someone else navigating the Kubernetes maze!

















We have a server which will proxy the request to other service but after we migrating to kuberentes we saw the `ECONNREFUSED` error happening frequently on our proxing server which affect our user expereince so i am start invesitigation why this happening there is one possibel reason `ECONNREFUSED` error will occured 
when the server is not listening on the PORT but our server are running properly

after some invesitagtion i find one intersting thing is the error accoured on the server when we deploying our code the server which are accepting the request and giving response so it is clear there is some thing wrong when we deploying 

As you have expirence with kubernetes how it handling the when we deploy. by default kubernetes will kill the old pod until new pod get up so there is no chance for downtime  but there is problem there is alaways server take few sec to server to accept the request which is technically called cold start time so it take few sec but our kubernetes will not wait untill that to fix that we need to have readineess probe you may think we dont have it but you are wrong we have probe so kubenetes will kill the our old pod when our new pod are reddy to accept 

so there is no chance for downtime but we facing issue so i started digging dive in to the issue and explored how under the hood kuberntes proxy the request and how it works and find out this articel which is really give me a insigts about how it works and i got to know what might be the reason

so i will try to explain as short as possibel when we create a deploy a new code kubernetes will start creating new container and keep the old container until the new pod redniess probe get sucessied so until that any request came it will be processed by the old pod but when the new pod is up it will update the new Ip address on kube proxy ip table such that kube proxy will know here after i need to proxy the request to new pod so the issue is here it take more 10 to 15s the ip table get updated so when new pod readness probe get sucessed it will send the `SIGTERM` single to the old and and it get killed before the ip table get updated so the request that coming mean while are not able to processed becuase the pod get killed 

So to solve this we need to wait for 10 15 sec after receviing `SIGTERM` singal and process the recevied request so far once it done close the server and exit the process 

so i made the changes in a code as below 

```js
process.on("SIGTERM", async function () {
//waited for 15 sec
await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 15000));
//do the rest of thing closing db ,server and other things
});
```

After the changes it got fixed so finaly the case came to the end hope you learned something today
