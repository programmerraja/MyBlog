Welcome back to **"Code Against the Clock!"** blog series where I’ll reveal how I turned my most boring tasks into streamlined, time-saving machines. I’ll share the exact steps I took to automate these chores and the cool tricks I discovered along the way. Ready to see how you can save time and make life a bit more exciting? Let’s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!
## My Unexpected Online Hustle

Let’s rewind to my college days. I was on a quest to find ways to earn some extra cash online while learning something new. During my research, I stumbled upon a service called Sbitly. The concept was intriguing: it’s a URL shortening platform where you paste a long link, and it gives you a shortened version. The twist? When people click on these shortened links, they first see an ad before being redirected to the original site. You get paid for each click, and it seemed like a neat way to earn money.

I thought, "Why not automate this process?" With a bit of Python and Selenium magic, I set out to streamline this task and see how far I could take it.

**The Automation Project:**

Here’s a peek into how I tackled this project:

**1. Tools of the Trade:**

- **Python:** Chosen for its simplicity and versatility. It’s a powerhouse for scripting and automation.
- **Selenium:** The go-to tool for web automation. It allows you to control a web browser programmatically, making it perfect for interacting with web interfaces.

**2. The Plan:**

- **Scraping Tech Blogs:** I wanted to gather a list of tech blog URLs to shorten. Sites like House of Bots, Fossbytes, and The Hacker News were my targets. For this, I used Python’s BeautifulSoup library to scrape these sites for interesting blog links.

- **Shortening URLs:** Using Selenium, I automated the process of visiting Sbitly, pasting the URLs, and retrieving shortened links.

- **Sharing on Facebook:** Finally, I needed to share these shortened URLs on Facebook and in Facebook groups. Again, Selenium was used to automate the posting process, ensuring that all the links were shared efficiently.

**Note:** As of now, the Sbitly website is no longer active. The automation techniques and code examples shared here are based on my experience with the platform while it was operational.

```
#### **1. Background:** - **Setting:** A lively digital workspace or a tech-themed room filled with elements like computers, code snippets, and browser windows. The background can have a vibrant mix of colors to reflect excitement and innovation. #### **2. Main Characters:** - **Automator Character:** - **Appearance:** A cartoon character representing you, dressed as a tech wizard or automation guru. and a lab coat to emphasize the “techie” aspect and he was a college studuent - **Expression:** Focused and enthusiastic, interacting with multiple screens or devices. - **Selenium Browser Bot:** - **Appearance:** A friendly robot or an assistant character, perhaps with a selenium logo or gear symbol, assisting in the automation process. - **Expression:** Helpful and cheerful, working alongside the main character. #### **3. Key Visual Elements:** - **Python Code:** Show snippets of Python code or a Python logo in the background or on a computer screen, highlighting the tool used for automation. - **Selenium Browser Window:** Display a browser window with elements like URL fields and buttons being clicked or filled in, emphasizing the automation of web interactions. - **URL Shortening:** Illustrate the process of pasting and shortening a URL, maybe with a URL shrinking into a short form with a “click” animation effect. - **Facebook Integration:** Show a cartoon Facebook post being created with the shortened URL, with likes and shares popping up to signify the social media aspect. #### **4. Title Text:** - **Text:** "Automating Money earning: Python & Selenium Magic!" - **Font:** Bold and modern font, with playful accents to match the cartoon theme. Consider using tech-inspired fonts or styles. #### **5. Additional Details:** - **Exciting Colors:** Use a bright color palette with blues, greens, and oranges to make the image eye-catching and dynamic. #### **Visual Composition:** - **Foreground:** Place the main characters prominently in the center, actively engaging with the automation tasks. - **Background:** Incorporate elements related to code, web automation, and social media in a way that adds context without cluttering the image. - **Title Placement:** Position the title text at the top or bottom of the image, ensuring it stands out against the background.
