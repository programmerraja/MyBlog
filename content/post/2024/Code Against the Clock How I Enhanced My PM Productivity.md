Welcome back to **": Code Against the Clock :!"** blog series where Iâ€™ll reveal how I turned my most boring tasks into streamlined, time-saving machines. Iâ€™ll share the exact steps I took to automate these chores and the cool tricks I discovered along the way. Ready to see how you can save time and make life a bit more exciting? Letâ€™s dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!

## The backstory

Ever felt like managing sub-tasks in Jira was like trying to juggle flaming torches? ðŸ˜… In our bustling startup, we work in two-week sprints, and every Jira task often spawns a bunch of smaller sub-tasks. Keeping track of these can get pretty monotonous, and itâ€™s not exactly the highlight of our day.

**The Sprint Close Dilemma**

Hereâ€™s the kicker: At the end of each sprint, when our Project Manager (PM) tries to mark the sprint as complete, Jira throws a fit if there are unfinished sub-tasks. It demands that every single sub-task be closed before the sprint can be completed. Imagine the PMâ€™s frustrationâ€”either they have to manually close each sub-task or hunt down developers to update their statuses. This can drag on forever and pull them away from more strategic work.

**My Automation Adventure**

Determined to rescue our PM from this repetitive grind, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into scripting. Hereâ€™s how I transformed a mundane task into a streamlined solution:

1. **Crafting a Command Line Superhero:** I designed a command line tool thatâ€™s like a magic wand for our PM. It simplifies the process of closing sub-tasks and lets the PM select the sprint theyâ€™re working with.
2. **Sub-Task Closure on Autopilot:** This tool works like a charmâ€”it automatically identifies completed tasks and updates all their sub-tasks to "completed" status. No more manual updates or endless status-chasing!
3. **Boosting Efficiency:** Thanks to this automation, our PM now breezes through sprint closures. The tool does the heavy lifting quickly and accurately, freeing up time and reducing errors.

**The Payoff**

The impact has been fantastic! Our PM's workload has lightened, task management is spot-on, and they can now focus on more strategic, high-impact work. Itâ€™s like turning a mountain of paperwork into a molehill!
