Welcome back to **"Code Against the Clock!"** blog series where I‚Äôll reveal how I turned my most boring tasks into streamlined, time-saving machines. I‚Äôll share the exact steps I took to automate these chores and the cool tricks I discovered along the way. Ready to see how you can save time and make life a bit more exciting? Let‚Äôs dive in and get your tasks on autopilot!

## The backstory

I‚Äôm part of a startup that embraces Agile methodology, managing our work through two-week sprints with assigned tasks for the entire period. Each Jira ticket comes with sub-tasks, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîmost of us developers, including myself üòÖ, often forget to update these sub-tasks. As a result, when it‚Äôs time to close out the sprint, Jira flags these unfinished sub-tasks even if the main task is completed.

This means our PM has to manually go through and close each sub-task or chase down the developers to update them. Plus, before closing a sprint, we hold a retro meeting to analyze which tasks took too long, which ones bounced back and forth between testing and development, and figure out why. This involves manually checking task histories to calculate the time spent on each task and how often they changed status. It‚Äôs a tedious process that can take up a lot of valuable time.

To tackle this, I decided to leverage my scripting skills to automate these repetitive tasks. Here‚Äôs how I approached it:

1. **Command Line Tool**: I created a command line tool that simplifies the process for our PM. The tool can either close all sub-tasks for a specific sprint or perform detailed calculations based on task history.
    
2. **Closing Sub-Tasks**: When the PM opts to close sub-tasks, the tool fetches all completed status tasks from the sprint. It then updates all associated sub-tasks to completed status, saving the PM from manual updates.
    
3. **Calculating Task Metrics**: If the PM wants to analyze task metrics, the tool extracts all tasks from the sprint and examines their history logs. It calculates the time taken for development, testing, and any back-and-forth movements. The results are then exported as a CSV file, which can be imported into Google Sheets for further analysis.
    

By automating these tasks, we not only save time but also improve accuracy and efficiency. It‚Äôs a win-win for everyone involved!

Hello Techies welcome back another intersting blog series of `Automate Relax Repeat The Power of Coding` today i wil share how i save my product manger time my automating the jira task 

so i am basically working in startup where we following the Agile and we have a 2 weak sprint where we assingned the task for entire 2 week and we where work on the task and each jira ticket have a sub task in jira ticket but mostly no dev will update the subtask status including me :sweat_smile  so after 2 weak of sprint where they try to close compelete the sprint where jira will list all task that subtask status not moved to compeleted but parent task is in compeleted so our PM mostly try to close each subtack manually or ask the dev to do  and before closing the sprint we have a retro where they need to find out whihc task take more time and which task go back and foth between tester and they choose the task and invistegate why it is like and how we can avoid and why the task is taken so much time does that required time or any blocker faced by dev team is there is any way we can avoid on further sprint so to find no of days it take for dev and test and no of time it moved back and forth they manually check each task status moved date and time and status change frequency to calculate these and this is boring task so i want to save time to picked my scipting skill and started coding the algo will be like below
- A cmd line tool where ask PM what they want to do close all subtask in specific sprint or calculate above mention thing for a specific sprint
- Based on PM input if close all subtask i fetch all compelted status task from the sprint and go through all subtask and move the status to compeleted
- if they want calcuation i will fetch all task from the sprint and based on history log of task i will calclate amount of day taken for dev ,test and backend forth and write that as CSV where they can import in google sheet for further analysis
