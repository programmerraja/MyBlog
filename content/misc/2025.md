Have focus one onething and have clear path what to do instead of just studying random things

**Reasons for the Shiny Object Syndrome:**

- **The illusion of progress:** Starting something new creates excitement and a feeling of progress, even if it is not leading anywhere.
- **Lack of clarity:** Many people lack a clear vision of their career goals, making them susceptible to external influences.
- **Societal pressures:** The influence of parents, peers, and social media can lead people to pursue opportunities that are not aligned with their interests or goals.
- **Democratization of knowledge:** The easy availability of information online can create the feeling that one needs to learn all skills before being able to achieve anything.
- **Fear of missing out (FOMO):** Rapid changes in technology and industries can cause anxiety that one might miss out on a life-changing opportunity or skill.


**Consequences of the Shiny Object Syndrome:**

- Wasted time and effort.
- Surface-level knowledge in many areas instead of in-depth knowledge in one.
- Lack of compounded effort, which is needed to see real progress in one's career.

**Three-Step Framework to Overcome the Shiny Object Syndrome:**

1. **Define Your North Star:**
    - A **North Star** is a personal direction you want to go in, not a specific position or degree. It is not defined by parents, peers, or anyone other than yourself.
    - This acts as a guide, helping you to stay focused and avoid getting distracted by tangential ideas.
2. **The 90-Day Rule:**
    - Commit to a skill, project, or area of study for 90 days before considering something new.
    - During the 90 days, write down any new ideas that arise and explore them after the 90-day period is over.
    - This provides enough time to gain in-depth knowledge and see progress.
3. **Mentor Check:**
    - Seek advice from someone who is two or three steps ahead of you in your desired field, rather than relying on information solely from the internet.
    - This provides a reality check and helps to counter the biased view that can be created by only viewing success stories online.

- Speaking with a mentor provides a glimpse of your potential future self and can help you make informed decisions.

The video uses the analogy of cooking **biryani**, stating that success requires time, energy, resources, attention, and patience. Adding new "ingredients" (new skills or opportunities) constantly will ruin the end result. You need to allow the biryani to cook without constantly interfering, much like focusing on a particular goal or skill for a long period to achieve mastery.

The video also notes that when feeling stuck, a lack of motivation could be due to one or more of three undefined factors. The video will link to another video explaining these factors and how to overcome them.
