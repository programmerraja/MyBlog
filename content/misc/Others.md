## patta

**Patta** is an official document that signifies legal ownership of a piece of land. It is a government-issued record that confirms that an individual or entity has the right to use, possess, and manage a specific piece of land. The Patta document contains key details about the land, such as:

- Name of the owner
- Survey number
- Extent of the land
- Village and Taluk details
- Classification of land (whether itâ€™s agricultural, residential, etc.)

The Patta document is often used in land transactions, such as buying, selling, or transferring property. It is issued by the Revenue Department of the Tamil Nadu state government. The document helps to establish ownership and resolve any disputes related to land ownership or title.
