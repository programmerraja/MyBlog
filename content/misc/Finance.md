## Exchange traded funds 

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They are designed to track the performance of an underlying index, commodity, sector, or asset class. ETFs combine the features of mutual funds and stocks, making them a popular choice for investors.

### How ETFs Work:

- When you invest in an ETF, you buy shares of the fund. Each share represents a portion of the assets held by the ETF.
- The ETF tracks the performance of its underlying index or assets.
- Returns come from price appreciation, dividends, or interest earned by the underlying assets.

### Example:

If you invest in a **"Tech ETF"** that tracks major tech companies, you effectively own a small piece of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, depending on the ETF's composition.

ETFs are ideal for both beginners and experienced investors looking for diversification, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness in their portfolios.
