## Term insurance

Health insurance to avoid
- No co payment -> on claim they split money we need to pay some money 
- No restriction on room rent 
- check sublimits of dieases (they put how much they pay for heart diesese and other check that)
- pre and post hospitalization care did they covring this and how long
- opt for low waiting period
- restoration benefit & day care cover



If  invest in stock and we get more profit in first time and we dont have any assests to save tax we buy real estate form that money no tax for it


If we buy a real estate if we dont have any real estate
