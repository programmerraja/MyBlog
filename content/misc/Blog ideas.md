Hi, I'm an infra developer. My daily work involves fixing or investigating issues at the infrastructure level. I plan to write about these investigations in a blog series with a Sherlock Holmes detective theme. I need your help to write these blogs. I'll share the story, and you convert it into a perfect detective-themed blog. The blog should include:

- A warm introduction about the series and the issue we're going to investigate
- A step-by-step investigation with clear headings for each case, detailing what I checked and how
- A nice ending that hooks the reader for the upcoming series
- And important it need to be in plain englist don't use any jorgans
```
