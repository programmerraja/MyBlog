Learning technique
- Always have roadmap what flow you going to study such that you know where to go 
- Know why you learning
- Before reading blog have objective of what you going to get from it 


- **Set a timer for 10 minutes**: The time limit forces your brain to be efficient with the information. A time constraint creates a sense of urgency and helps the brain concentrate better, based on Parkinson's law.

- **Establish key learning objectives**: Before diving into the material, define why you are learning it and what you need to know. This helps to focus your efforts and avoid wasting time. Knowing what to look for will keep you actively engaged in your learning, rather than passively reading. You can use the syllabus, teacher hints, real-life applications, or even ask an AI like Chat GPT to help determine learning objectives.

- **Explore the map**: Do a quick first run through of the material, focusing on key elements such as headings, bold words, images, diagrams, and key concepts. This step is about identifying the 20% of the material that contains 80% of the important information. During this scan, you're not deep-diving into details but noting where to focus for answers to your objectives.

- **Draw your thought process**: After scanning the material, draw the core concepts and how they relate to each other using pen and paper or a stylus on a tablet. This should be done from memory and if you get it wrong, it is okay because the errors will help you learn better the next time you go through the material. This is known as the hypercorrection effect.

This "priming protocol" is intended to be the first step in the learning process, setting the stage for more in-depth learning later. The four steps of the priming protocol can be remembered with the acronym "SEED," which stands for setting a timer, establishing learning objectives, exploring the map, and drawing out your thought process.

The priming protocol helps with more effective learning because it avoids the common approach of aimlessly reading material from beginning to end, which can lead to poor retention and wasted time. The presenter likens this approach to going to the grocery store without a list in the dark. By contrast, priming provides a structured approach to learning, akin to having a detailed list, a map, and a practice run.

The priming protocol is useful not only for studying but also as a general life hack for quickly understanding new processes, such as assembling furniture, reviewing online courses, or reading research papers. The presenter notes that they were able to save 2 hours per day by using this technique because they were no longer passively reading and forgetting what they read, or having to re-learn material.

This technique is the first step that sets the stage for a subsequent technique called "tree note-taking," which is designed to further solidify learning.
