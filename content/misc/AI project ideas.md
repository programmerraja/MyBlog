- i am software developer with 2 year expereince mostly worked with MERN stack and infra struture level
- my skills are MERN stack, docker,kubernetes, elasticsearch ,meilisearch ,nginx etc
- my hobbies are i am writing blog of sharing my knowledge and mostly spend my weekend exporing new things on tech and i am manting my second brain in obsidain and which is hosted as github pages
- i always love to learn new things and build in tech 

so these are the things about suggest me what are the thing i can put on my page
for reference use this website https://bjornlu.com/

You was interviewer who doing interview of the canditate on Javascript stack 

Most of the canditate will be good in explaing question verbally but when we asked to write a code or ask tricky question they will not able to so you need to keep that in mind when creating questions also few canditate good in all theroy and tricky question but after when they joined and assinged a task from product to create a new feature or fix a bug in exising code base they where langing so you need to keep this also when genrating question so your question need to test all there knoweldege. also cover the does the canditate understand how the tech internally are working and question to test there debugging skills

The question also need to check the canditate expereince on sepecific tech

So give me the questions,problems,code to test there skill 

Note: In nodejs don't ask to implement REST,middelware ask some more different question that need less setup for canditate 


A rating system for Provide actionable suggestions for improving candidate feedback based on AI analysis of past feedback and outcomes.

- **Skill Assessment:** AI can map candidate responses to required skills and competencies for the role, providing a structured evaluation.
- **Competency Scoring:** Automatically score and rate responses based on predefined competencies
```

```
i have build a chrome extension that help me when i am taking interview where it will ask canditate name and other details and input where i can write the question that i asked and feedback for the canditate and when i click print it will give me as entriing thing as pdf 

so now i am planing to add mroe feature and integrate AI for generating question give some feauture that i can impelement in the extension
```

Why this project
- To solve selecting the canditate that not suite
- Save time 
- get expereince with AI
- Content for blog


**Role:** Interviewer for a JavaScript stack position

**Instructions:**
- Develop a set of interview questions and problems designed to assess a candidate's proficiency in Node.js.
- Ensure questions cover both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, including debugging and understanding of internal workings.
- Create scenarios that test the candidate's ability to write code, solve tricky problems, and handle real-world tasks like feature development or bug fixing.
- Focus on evaluating experience with Node.js, including asynchronous programming and system design.
- Avoid questions that require the implementation of REST or middleware; instead, opt for questions that require minimal setup.

**Context:**
- Candidates often excel in verbal explanations but struggle with practical coding tasks or real-world application.
- Some candidates might perform well in theory and tricky questions but falter when faced with actual coding tasks in a job setting.
- The goal is to assess candidates’ comprehensive skills and understanding, including debugging and practical problem-solving in Node.js.

**Constraints:**
- Avoid REST and middleware implementation questions in Node.js.
- Ensure questions are designed to test both theoretical and practical knowledge of asynchronous programming and system design.
- Include questions that require minimal setup to avoid time-consuming tasks during the interview.
- The question need covered all the above mentioned

**Examples:**
- Provide coding challenges that involve real-world scenarios like debugging Node.js code or adding a new feature to a Node.js application.
- Design theoretical questions that probe deep understanding of Node.js internals, such as event loops, callbacks, and promises.
- Create problems that test the ability to analyze and solve complex issues related to system design and asynchronous operations with minimal setup required.

**Difficulty Levels:**
- **Beginner:** Questions that test basic knowledge and fundamental concepts of Node.js and asynchronous programming.
- **Intermediate:** Questions that explore more complex scenarios and require a deeper understanding of Node.js internals and system design.
- **Advanced:** Questions that challenge the candidate’s ability to handle intricate problems and advanced concepts in Node.js and system architecture.

Note: The interview will be happen for one hour so the question you will be given enough for the one hour

Provide me the output in Array of json
