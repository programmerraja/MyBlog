### Liquid funds

A **Liquid Fund** is a type of mutual fund that primarily invests in short-term money market instruments like **Treasury Bills**, **Commercial Papers**, **Certificates of Deposit**, and **Repurchase Agreements (Repos)**. These instruments are typically highly liquid and have short maturities (less than 91 days), making liquid funds ideal for parking surplus cash for a very short period.

#### Arbitrage Fund

An **Arbitrage Fund** is a type of mutual fund that aims to profit from the price differences in the cash and derivative (futures) markets. The primary strategy used by arbitrage funds is **arbitrage**, which involves buying a security in one market (e.g., the spot or cash market) where it is undervalued and simultaneously selling it in another market (e.g., the futures market) where it is overvalued.

Consider the following scenario in the **stock market**:

- Stock X is trading at ₹100 on **Exchange A**.
- The same stock X is trading at ₹102 on **Exchange B**.
- An arbitrage trader could:
    1. Buy Stock X on **Exchange A** at ₹100.
    2. Sell the same stock X on **Exchange B** at ₹102.
    3. Lock in a ₹2 profit per share.

Over 1 year no tax. 6% interset rate 

if you getting money before one year use **dividend** option to reduce the tax

You can choose from different payout frequencies such as **monthly**, **quarterly**, or **annual** dividend payouts. Monthly dividends are more common with **liquid or debt-based arbitrage funds**.

### **Summary of Mutual Fund Types**:

- **Equity Funds**: Invest in stocks with a focus on long-term growth.
- **Debt Funds**: Invest in bonds and other fixed-income securities for income and stability.
- **Hybrid Funds**: Combine equity and debt for a balanced approach.
- **Index Funds & ETFs**: Passively replicate the performance of a market index.
- **Actively Managed Funds**: Managed by professionals aiming to beat the market.
- **Passively Managed Funds**: Track an index or benchmark with minimal management.

Each type of mutual fund serves different investment goals based on factors like risk tolerance, time horizon, and desired return. Diversification across different types can help mitigate risk and optimize returns.

In return, the organization promises to pay the investor **interest** on the money they lent, usually at regular intervals (like every year or every six months).

At the **end of the bond's term** (called the **maturity**), the organization will return the **original amount of money** (called the **principal** or **face value**) to the investor.

It is similar to giving for vatti and interset

Types
- secure bond (low interset,low risk) there are assets backing the bond, if the issuer defaults (fails to repay), the bondholder can claim those assets to recover their money.  (like we giving gold to bank to get money )
- unsecure bond (has high interest high risk) No assests like credit card

Things to check
- maturity data -> when they give whole money back
- copoun rate -> interset rate

## Return calculation

if we investing the amount for a particular period of time and we withdrawing the money after some time we would like to know how much return i get we can use the two method
- **CAGR** is used when you make a **single lump-sum investment** and then **withdraw** it after a certain period of time. It tells you the average annual growth rate of your investment, assuming the investment grows at a **steady rate** over the period.
- **XIRR** is used when you make **irregular or periodic investments** (e.g., monthly or quarterly) and **withdraw** money at different times. Unlike CAGR, **XIRR accounts for the exact timing of your cash flows**, which makes it more accurate when there are **multiple contributions** or **withdrawals**.

Example
CAGR
- If an investment grows from ₹1,00,000 to ₹2,00,000 over 5 years, the CAGR would be: 14.87% over 5 years.

XIRR
- If you made an investment of ₹1,00,000 on 1st Jan 2020, followed by ₹20,000 on 1st July 2021, and ₹30,000 on 1st Jan 2022, and you got back ₹2,00,000 on 1st Jan 2023, the XIRR calculation would reflect the return considering the exact dates of cash flows.
