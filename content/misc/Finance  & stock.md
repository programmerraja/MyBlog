An **Arbitrage Fund** is a type of mutual fund that aims to profit from the price differences in the cash and derivative (futures) markets. The primary strategy used by arbitrage funds is **arbitrage**, which involves buying a security in one market (e.g., the spot or cash market) where it is undervalued and simultaneously selling it in another market (e.g., the futures market) where it is overvalued.

Consider the following scenario in the **stock market**:

- Stock X is trading at ₹100 on **Exchange A**.
- The same stock X is trading at ₹102 on **Exchange B**.
- An arbitrage trader could:
    1. Buy Stock X on **Exchange A** at ₹100.
    2. Sell the same stock X on **Exchange B** at ₹102.
    3. Lock in a ₹2 profit per share.

Over 1 year no tax. 6% interset rate 

if you getting money before one year use **dividend** option to reduce the tax

You can choose from different payout frequencies such as **monthly**, **quarterly**, or **annual** dividend payouts. Monthly dividends are more common with **liquid or debt-based arbitrage funds**.

The **Buffett Indicator** is a popular stock market valuation metric named after Warren Buffett, who once referred to it as "probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment." It compares the total market value of publicly traded stocks to the overall economic output of a country.

The Buffett Indicator is expressed as a percentage,
- **< 75%**: The market may be undervalued.
- **75%-100%**: The market is fairly valued.
- **> 100%**: The market may be overvalued.
- **> 120%-150%**: Indicates a significant overvaluation and potential risk of a market correction.


#### **RSI (Relative Strength Index))** 

evaluate the momentum of price movements and identify overbought or oversold conditions. It is expressed as a percentage and ranges from 0 to 100.

Example
- When the seesaw **goes too high on one side**, it might need to come back down soon.
- When it **goes too low on the other side**, it might bounce back up soon.

The **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** is like a seesaw for the price of a stock:

- **Above 70**: It means the stock has gone up a lot (too high), and it might come down soon.
- **Below 30**: It means the stock has gone down a lot (too low), and it might go up soon.

It helps people decide:
- "Should I buy because it’s too low?"
- "Should I sell because it’s too high?"

## Buying on DIP

- Buy stock when **Buffett Indicator** less then 75% But make sure the fundamental of the stock is good


## Small case

- A smallcase is a **basket of stocks** that are related to a single theme.
- Smallcases are created by **SEBI-licensed research analysts and investment advisors**.
- These professionals manage the smallcases, handling stock selection and rebalancing.

**Costs Associated with Smallcase Investments**

- **Investment Charges**:
    - For investments **less than ₹4,000**, the charge is **2.5% of the investment amount plus GST**.
    - For investments **equal to or greater than ₹4,000**, the charge is a flat **₹100 plus GST**, regardless of the investment amount.
- **Selling Charges**:
    - There are **no charges** when selling a smallcase, except for taxes.
    - If the holding period is **less than or equal to one year**, the gains are taxed as **short-term capital gains (STCG) at 15%**.
    - If the holding period is **more than one year**, the gains are taxed as **long-term capital gains (LTCG) at 10%**, but only if the LTCG is greater than ₹1 lakh.
- **Rebalancing Charges**:
    - Smallcase does **not charge a fee** for rebalancing.
    - However, rebalancing involves selling existing stocks and buying new ones, so **brokerage and taxes (STCG or LTCG)** are applicable.

**Other Aspects of Smallcase**

- **Dividends**: Investors are eligible to receive dividends from the stocks held within a smallcase, and the same tax rules that apply to regular dividends are applicable.
- **Rebalancing**:
    - Rebalancing is **not mandatory**; you will receive an email notification to accept or deny the changes.
- **Minimum Investment**:
    - There is **no fixed minimum investment** amount. Some smallcases have a minimum as low as ₹270.
    - You can filter smallcases by investment amount to find those with low minimums.
- **Brokers**: Smallcase has tie-ups with a large number of Indian brokers.
- **Tracking**: While you cannot track smallcase investments on the Zerodha app, you can track them on the Kite web portal by selecting the "smallcase" option in the holdings dropdown menu.

**Smallcase vs Mutual Funds**

- **Similarities**: Both are managed by professionals.
- **Differences**:
    - **Ownership**: In a mutual fund, you own units of the fund, while in a smallcase, you own the individual stocks.
    - **Rebalancing**: In a smallcase, you have the option to accept or deny rebalancing; in a mutual fund, the fund manager does rebalancing without your consent.
    - **Tax and Brokerage**: Rebalancing in a smallcase incurs brokerage and taxes; in a mutual fund, rebalancing does not incur separate charges.
    - **Exit Load**: Smallcases do not have exit loads, unlike some mutual funds.
    - **Customization**: Smallcases offer more customization with ready-made themes and strategies; you can select based on investment amount, volatility, and investment strategy.


## Return calculation

if we investing the amount for a particular period of time and we withdrawing the money after some time we would like to know how much return i get we can use the two method
- **CAGR** is used when you make a **single lump-sum investment** and then **withdraw** it after a certain period of time. It tells you the average annual growth rate of your investment, assuming the investment grows at a **steady rate** over the period.
- **XIRR** is used when you make **irregular or periodic investments** (e.g., monthly or quarterly) and **withdraw** money at different times. Unlike CAGR, **XIRR accounts for the exact timing of your cash flows**, which makes it more accurate when there are **multiple contributions** or **withdraw//only need to rewrite the url if it have user id als**.

Example
CAGR
- If an investment grows from ₹1,00,000 to ₹2,00,000 over 5 years, the CAGR would be: 14.87% over 5 years.

XIRR
- If you made an investment of ₹1,00,000 on 1st Jan 2020, followed by ₹20,000 on 1st July 2021, and ₹30,000 on 1st Jan 2022, and you got back ₹2,00,000 on 1st Jan 2023, the XIRR calculation would reflect the return considering the exact dates of cash flows.

## IRR

Rate of interset of a year


**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** in the context of stock refers to the annualized effective compounded return rate that an investor earns on an investment, assuming the investment generates a series of cash flows over time. IRR is often used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or compare the attractiveness of different investments.


### **Finance & Investment Tips**

1. **Stock Selection**:
    - Focus on growing sectors (e.g., electric vehicles).
    - Research companies within the chosen sector.
    - Invest systematically, instead of lump-sum.
2. **Direct vs. Regular Mutual Fund Plans**:
    - **Direct Plans**: Lower expense ratio as there’s no intermediary.
    - **Regular Plans**: Higher expense ratio due to commission paid to distributors.

Key Ratios Explained

Standard Deviation: Measures the total risk of a fund's portfolio and how much the return deviates from the expected return. A higher standard deviation means higher volatility.

Sorno Ratio: Measures the risk-adjusted performance of a fund, specifically focusing on downside risk. A higher ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns2. Generally a ratio between 1 and 2 is considered good2.

Beta: Measures the risk of a fund compared to the market. A beta less than 1 indicates lower risk than the market, and a beta greater than 1 indicates higher risk than the market2.

Upside Capture Ratio: Measures how well a fund performs relative to the benchmark during a rising market2.

Downside Capture Ratio: Measures how well a fund performs relative to the benchmark during a falling market

Operating Profit Margin: This indicates the profitability of a company’s core operations.

Return on Equity (ROE): This measures how efficiently a company is using shareholders' investments to generate profit. A ROE of 15% or higher is considered a good benchmark2.

**Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)** is a financial metric that measures a company's ability to generate profits from its capital employed (the total capital used for running the business). (higher is good)

Free Cash Flow: This is the cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, indicating financial health and flexibility2.

Market Capitalization: Companies can be categorized by their size and this will influence the type of stocks you choose2.

The **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** is a widely used financial metric that helps investors assess the valuation of a company's stock relative to its earnings. It represents how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings and provides insight into how the market values the company’s future earnings growth.



Invester type
- **Value Investing**: Looks for **undervalued** stocks that have the potential to grow over time. 
- **Growth Investing**: Focuses on companies with **strong potential for future growth**, even if their current valuation is high.
- **Momentum Investing**: Seeks to profit from **current trends** in stock prices, buying stocks that are rising and selling those that are falling.


### Value investing 

Value investing is a strategy that involves picking stocks that are trading at a lower price than their intrinsic value

**Graham's Seven Criteria for Value Investing:**

1. **Company Size:**
    - Avoid very small companies because their financial numbers tend to fluctuate wildly.
    - Focus on fairly large companies with stable earnings.
    - For the Indian market, a **market cap greater than 20,000 CR rupees** is a good starting point.
    - The screener.in website can be used to filter stocks based on market cap.
2. **Current Ratio:**
    - The current ratio is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity, which indicates how easily the company can liquidate assets to pay off liabilities.
    - **Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**.
    - A higher current ratio is generally better.
    - An ideal current ratio is between **1.5 and 3**.
    - This can be added as a filter on the screener.
3. **Dividend Payment History:**
    - Companies that are financially sound and stable should be giving healthy dividends.
    - This criteria is done manually rather than on the stock screener.
4. **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:**
    - EPS is the company's earnings (profit) divided by the total number of shares, indicating how much wealth is generated for each shareholder.
    - If a company's EPS is growing over multiple years, it is a good indication of growth.
    - A suitable query for a stock screener is: **EPS greater than last year, and cumulative EPS growth over the last 3 years greater than 10%**.
    - 
5. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:**
    - **P/E Ratio = Share Price / Earnings Per Share**.
    - Benjamin Graham suggested a P/E ratio less than 9, but that is difficult to find in India.
    - A modified rule can be used, where the company's P/E ratio is **less than the industry P/E ratio**.
6. **Price-to-Book Value (P/B) Ratio:**
    - **P/B Ratio = Price Per Share / Book Value Per Share**.
    - Book value gives an indication of the company's assets and liabilities.
    - Graham suggested a P/B ratio of less than 1.2, which is difficult to find in India, especially today.
7. **Financial Leverage:**
    - Avoid companies with high debt, as that can create problems for the company in the future.
    - A company with low debt is more likely to show sustainable growth.
    - The suggestion is to look for companies with a **Total Debt / Current Asset ratio less than 1.1**.

Screener link ->https://www.screener.in/screens/1542082/value-investing-with-benjamin-graham/


EPS -> 
- Profit eanred divided by total share holded by only invester 
- Disadvantage if we have EPS 10ruppe per share but the share price is 1K it not good so we need PE ratio

PE -> this ratio tell how much amount invester compared to the profit for example 
	10 rupee is EPS and 1k per share then  10/1k = 100 which is represent user buyed stock 100% more then here profit

Debt to EQT -> We need captial to start the company so we bought 1k as debt and 1K from EQT so we have debt to EQT ratio as 1  

Return on EQT -> let say we get 200 profit and we need to pay 50 as interset for the debt we pay now we have 150 so 150/1k is return on EQT 

ROE ->  Return on eqt which is missleading so dont just look for this
 Scenario 1: Low Debt (High Equity)

- **Net Income**: $150
- **Equity (EQT)**: $1,000
- **Debt**: $0
- 15%

Scenario 2: High Debt (Low Equity)
- **Net Income**: $150 (same as above)
- **Equity (EQT)**: $500 (because the company borrowed $500)
- **Debt**: $500
- 30%


Return on captial employee
ROCE considers both **debt and equity** as part of the capital employed in the business. It measures how efficiently the company is using all the capital (both equity and debt) to generate operating profits (EBIT).




IF company don't have debt mean 2 thing 
- company may have good profit and sufficent money
- Company not interested to grow by buying debt

At the **end of the bond's term** (called the **maturity**), the organization will return the **original amount of money** (called the **principal** or **face value**) to the investor.

It is similar to giving for vatti and interset

Types
